# Rank Distribution

---

Like all healthy competitive games, Dota has meaningless titles to brag to your friends. However, unlike League who revolutionized the medal system from Bronze to Diamond, Dota had to make it as complicated as humanly possible. The naming conventions at first glance means nothing, but if you remember one thing, know that <b className="text-red-300">Immortal</b> is equivalent to Masters+, while <b className="text-brown-300">Herald</b> is equivalent to Iron 4. Underneath is the Dec 2024 rank distribution and how it compares to Leagues Dec 2024 rank distributon:

## MMR vs Ranks

---

A lot of time, you will hear Dota 2 boomers talk about their MMR more than the rank name they have achieved. This is a number that is within 0-10,000+. I say 10,000+ because this number gets surpassed every year. Nearly all players are within 0-6,000 while the real shut-ins and pros are above this range.
