# DotaM's Dota 2 Guide for New Players

---

Welcome to Dota 2! Here, you'll learn about Dota's heroes, roles, items, and how to navigate the game without wanting to uninstall after a single match. Dota’s notorious for its complexity, and we know that in the world of MOBAs, you’re probably already used to a learning curve that feels more like a learning cliff. Our goal here is to introduce more players to this wonderful game, despite how awful it is to be a new player.

If you're coming from League, a big difference between it and Dota is that Leagues fundamental mechanics (Items, Laning, Objectives) are so clear that they're almost mindless. The main difficulty stems from the champion you choose to int with, allowing most players to be able to be tunnel visioned into learning <b>champions</b> vs learning the game itself. Besides a handful of difficult heroes, most of Dota 2's heroes are relatively simple; no skill shots, almost all point and click abilities, some heroes even have more passives than abilities. <b>So most of the difficulty from Dota stems from the games fundamental mechanics.</b> Controlling more units than just your hero, creep management, courier, secret shop, even items in general! Theres so much information that you need before being able to sit down and play the damn game. But once you get past this hurdle, its beyond worth it.
