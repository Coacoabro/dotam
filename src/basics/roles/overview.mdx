# Dota 2 Roles Explained

---

Dota 2, like League, has 5 heroes that try their hardest to not flame (impossible). As explained in the <Link href="/basics/introduction/welcome" className="font-bold text-cyan-300">Introduction</Link> section, Dota 2 assigns specific roles to each player before the match starts. These roles are split up in 5 <span className="font-bold">Positions</span> that are determined by the amount of <b className="text-gold-400">gold</b> you should have by the end of the game. 

These next sections will go over every lane and specifically:

- Where they should go at the start of the game
- What is expected of them every game
- What heroes are typical and easier to use
